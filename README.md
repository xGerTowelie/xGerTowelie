# Marcel Maier (Towelie)

## üëã Hi, I'm Marcel!

I'm a 28-year-old computer science graduate from Germany with a deep passion for efficiency and a love for exploring new technologies. With 7 years of professional experience, including 5 years in Progress 4GL, I've expanded my skills across various programming languages and tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Do

Efficiency is my game, and I leverage the Linux ecosystem (using WSL) alongside tools like tmux and nvim to streamline my development workflow. Here's a snapshot of some of my projects:

- **[wsl-autoinstall](https://github.com/xGerTowelie/wsl)**: A batch script to fully automate the setup of a fresh WSL instance, including dependencies, configurations, SSH setup, and GitHub authentication.
- **[teleport](https://github.com/xGerTowelie/teleport)**: A Go-based tool for managing tmux sessions with fzf for quick access and configuration.
- **[filemanager](https://github.com/xGerTowelie/filemanager)**: A Vim-inspired terminal file manager for seamless filesystem navigation and file operations.
- **[todos](https://github.com/xGerTowelie/todos)**: A TUI-based tool using Urwid (Python) to organize to-do lists in a `README.md` file.
- **[project-manager](https://github.com/xGerTowelie/pm)**: A TUI-based tool to display the status of all Git repositories in a project folder and edit multiple repos in parallel, developed with Urwid (Python) and Vim motions.
- **[v0-Filemerge](https://github.com/xGerTowelie/v0-filemerge)**: CLI tool to load complete projects into the v0 AI (Limited file upload).

Currently, I'm focused on developing web applications using React/Next.js, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind, deploying them on Vercel or Coolify.
