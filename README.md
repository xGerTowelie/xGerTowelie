## 👋 Hi, I'm Marcel [Towelie]!

I’m a 28-year-old computer science graduate from Germany with a deep passion for efficiency and a love for exploring new technologies. With 5 years of experience in Progress 4GL, I've expanded my skills across various programming languages and tools.

### 🛠️ What I Do
Efficiency is my game, and I leverage the Linux ecosystem (using WSL) alongside tools like tmux and nvim to streamline my development workflow. Here’s a snapshot of some of my projects:

- **[wsl-autoinstall](https://github.com/xGerTowelie/wsl)**: A batch script to fully automate the setup of a fresh WSL instance, including dependencies, configurations, SSH setup, and GitHub authentication.
- **[teleport](https://github.com/xGerTowelie/teleport)**: A Go-based tool for managing tmux sessions with fzf for quick access and configuration.
- **[filemanager](https://github.com/xGerTowelie/filemanager)**: A Vim-inspired terminal file manager for seamless filesystem navigation and file operations.

Currently, I’m focused on developing web applications using React/Next.js, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind, deploying them on Vercel or Coolify. 

### 🔧 Tools of the Trade
I use a **Kinesis 360 Pro** keyboard with a custom-built firmware to maximize typing efficiency and reduce strain. Additionally, I navigate the web effortlessly with the Chrome extension **Vimium**, ensuring I rarely need to touch the mouse.

### 🚀 Outside of Coding
I share my projects and insights on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@towelie_dev) and [X](https://x.com/Towelie_dev). Connect with me there to follow my journey and discoveries!

Let’s innovate and enhance productivity together!

Cheers, Towelie ✌️
